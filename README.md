# Hawk-Dove
This project was an assignment for the course 'Research Methods for Computer Science' of Utrecht University.
The goal was to create our own model of the [Hawk-Dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)#Hawk%E2%80%93dove) principle, and to answer the research question _"How does an Agent‚Äôs initial aggressiveness in a hawk-dove scenario influence the eventual aggressiveness-equilibrium between two Agents, if one occurs?"_.

Included in this repo is the [paper](https://github.com/SilasPeters/Hawk-Dove/blob/9fbed07eba6fb02dca2a5d0cb9c07b4a3688be63/Hawk-Dove%20-%20Olaf%20Boekholt%2C%20Fabian%20Rutte%2C%20Silas%20Peters.pdf), which contains the result of this project, but also a complete explenation of the structure of this project (and thus implicitly of this repo).

Special thanks to [FabianRutte](https://github.com/FabianRutten) and [OlafBoekholt](https://github.com/olafboekholt) for working together on this project. üê¢
