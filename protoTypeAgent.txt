score
aggressiveness
iteration

je kan het onderzoek uitbreiden door ook de history van je tegenstander's zetten mee te nemen en of diens score.


Agent:
	history > [aggressiveness (float) or stance,score]
	historyRange > integer value (hoe ver kan je terug kijken)
	ChanceHawk > 
			take all history from |last-histeryRange| till |last|
			take average score increase(decrease for negative)
				for hawk
				for dove
			or	
				foreach aggr/score check its previous in the history range
					note for each increase in aggr the score diff
					note for each decrease in aggr the score diff
					average these ^^^^
					the highest average is the next one -> increase or decrease
		returns aggressiveness (float)


output for manually searching equillibrium
	assign history to agent per iteration
	assign history range initially
	agents exist during the whole test
	per agent:
		aggressiveness
		score
	iterations

base a algorithm on finding, to find equillibriums

output for research question:
	initial aggresivness agent one
	initial aggresivenss agent two
	ratio of scores of both agents (equillibrium)
